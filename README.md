# The single channel queuing model can be fitted in situations where the following seven conditions are fulfilled:

1. The number of arrivals per unit of time is described by poisson distribution. The mean arrival rate is denoted by λ.
2. The service time has exponential distribution. The average service rate is denoted by μ.
3. Arrivals are from infinite population.
4. The queue discipline is FIFO, that is, the customers are served on a first come first serve basis.
5. There is only a single service station.
6. The mean arrival rate is less than the mean service rate i.e. λ < μ.
7. The waiting space available for customers in the queue is infinite.

## Problem Statement
Now, simulate this bank problem having µ=5.6 customers/minute (arrival rate) and λ=5 customers/minute (service rate) for 20 customers. You should use exactly 19 to 20 random variates for generating the random variables(two). You don’t need to consider after precision values of decimal point for service times during simulation for the convenience. You can use any subroutine, object, or any built-in function of any relevant programming language. The average number of customer waiting, the average waiting time of a customer should be your statistical estimators for examining the true characteristics of the system.

[ Note: here I used 'POISSON DISTRIBUTION' for Inter Arrival Time generation & I used 'EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION' for service time generation ]
